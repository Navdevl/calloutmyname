<h1 id="the-dream">The Dream</h1>

<p>The wind blew heavily on my cheeks. The descending rays of the sunset kept me calm. Not having any idea of how I got here, I start to walk. The reflection of the sun glimmers on the lake to my left. Despite all these beautiful phenomenon, I feel a sense of fear.  Why though? Is something bad going to happen?</p>

<p>Then I felt something, something that was not present before. I see to my right and there is this intriguing building. It was so beautiful, I was being pulled towards it by some unknown force. But as I was getting close to the building, I started shivering. It got worse as I got closer. I couldn’t feel my skins anymore and despite the sun, the warmth that everything around me could feel, I felt really cold.</p>

<p>I was now very certain that there was someone else with me. Everything that was in view, everything beautiful started to fade away now.
Suddenly my hands felt wet. I looked down to see what was happening to my hand and to my shock someone else was holding my hand. The hand was holding with a really tight grip, felt like a cry for help. The hand looked very pale and grave. There was a ring on the index finger, a silver ring with a green stone studded on it.</p>

<p><strong>“Nothing you see is real. No, not even me.”</strong></p>

<p>Said a voice from behind my shoulders. A woman’s voice. As I tried to turn around and look at who she was, she left my hand. She wasn’t there anymore and everything went to black.</p>

<p>The next thing I remember, I wake in my room with no clarity of what just happened.  The Air Conditioner was on, yet I was sweating profusely. I look at my phone, it was 7:30 in the AM.  I had 2 missed calls. It was from AK, a writer, an associate, my best friend.</p>

<p>I then proceeded to cancel the alarm that was set for 8. Hesitantly, I woke up and sat there on the bed looking around. Everything looked the same. Nothing looked different from the night before. The posters of The Beatles, Kanye West, A.R. Rahman and Lana Del Rey hanging on the wall. My Typewriter sitting there on my desk near the window crying from within to be used. Yet, something felt different.</p>

<p>I switched off the A/C, jumped out of bed, opened the window and I looked at the sky wondering. This dream that I had, it had me thinking. Was it a message? Was it a premonition? I was getting lost again, but this time in thoughts. Who was that girl? I felt a great sense of connection towards this particular dream.</p>

<p>I mean, weird dreams are not something new to me, let alone the creepy dose of hallucinations that occasionally pop up. But the connection was strong with this one. Then, the idea struck me. Why not write about it? Huh?</p>

<p>The Phone rang, I picked it up.</p>

<p><em>“What the fuck are you doing man? I’ve been trying to reach you for more than half an hour”</em> said the voice from the other end of the call.</p>

<p>“Sorry bro. I just got lost in weird dream. Will be there in 10 mins”</p>

<p>“We can talk about that, but move your ass, it’s really hot outside.”</p>

<p>I cut the call. Rushed to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, and took a quick bath, put on a plain black collared t-shirt, my favorite camo shorts. Then I looked at the mirror one last time before I headed out. I looked damn tired. I put on my crocs and rushed downstairs to meet AK all the while having a deep thought about the dream.</p>

<p>AK was standing near the gate, evidently impatient. He was leaning on his bike wearing his usual style of plain black pants and light colored tops and of course, his iconic round specs.</p>

<p>I waved at him. He didn’t react. I knew I was in trouble now. I walked to him knowing what he was going to say. But hey, he is a gem and whatever he does, I abide by it.</p>

<p>“Hey, the only reason I came here this early is because you wanted me to come. You said you wanted help. But this is what you do? You make me wait?” AK said furiously.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, my phone was on silent and like I said I was having this weird dr-“</p>

<p>“Stop” AK Interrupted.</p>

<p>“First, let’s go get some coffee or breakfast, then we can talk. “ He said scratching his beard restlessly.</p>

<p>“Alright, Fair enough. I am paying.” I insisted.</p>

<p>“Of course dude” He replied with a smile.</p>

<p>Then we proceeded to walk towards the corner of the street, where there was this shop where we both have coffee, breakfast and smoke cigarettes on most of the mornings. That particular tea shop is like our little creative space where we both exchange thoughts, ideas and other things.</p>

<p>The shop’s owner Ravi saw us coming in, greeted us with a smile. He was looking happier today than usual. The shop wasn’t crowded as it was a bit early. Our usual seats were empty thankfully. That particular table at the far left end of the shop feels more comfortable than the other tables. Ravi was making tea in his unique style as we started to ascend the 5 stepped stairs into the shop.</p>

<p>“The usual?” He asked.</p>

<p>“Yes Please” Replied AK as we sat on our usual chair.</p>

<p>Then he turned towards me and asked “So, What’s up?”</p>

<p>“So, the reason I called you was to, you know it’s been 6 months since my last book got published and I haven’t been able to type in a single word after that. Writer’s block man. I think I am depressed.” I sighed.</p>

<p>“I get you man, but trust me, I know you, you’ll come up with something. The key is to be patient.” AK said.
“Yeah yeah. Hopefully.” I said filled with despair.</p>

<p>Ravi came to the table, served us two cups of coffee and handed us our usual brand of cigarettes and a lighter.</p>

<p>“How are you today Shiva?” he asked me.</p>

<p>“I’ve had better days, How about you?”</p>

<p>AK in the meanwhile lit his cigarette and I lit mine.</p>

<p>“Yeah good, Business is good” Ravi said positive as usual.</p>

<p>“Guess what?” He asked, his eyes filled with excitement. He quickly went to his desk and took a book from inside, and handed it over to me. The cover read ‘Call out my Name – written by Shiva’.</p>

<p>“I finally finished reading your book” he said.</p>

<p>“Cool man, what’d you think about it?” I asked</p>

<p>“It was very complex for me to understand. I am not used to books. After reading your book though, I might start to read some. It was really good. I could really feel the emotions you tried to portray. I was lost with the characters. Loved it.  But tell me this? Why did you go for romance as your genre?”</p>

<p>“Oh God, don’t ask him that” AK Interrupted me before I could say anything so I started sipping my coffee and listened to what he had to say.</p>

<p>“If he starts, he will take an entire day to finish. Let me tell you instead. You know in simple words. He wrote the book for his girlfriend. So, everything you read in there is mostly inspired by his relationship.”</p>

<p>“Wow, that’s great Shiv! You never said you have a girlfriend!” Ravi exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Had. Broke Up. ” AK responded.</p>

<p>Ravi turned looked at me with a long poker face.</p>

<p>“It’s alright Ravi. No worries, and you can keep the book if you want to, it was for you anyways” I said with a wink.</p>

<p>He smiled and went back to attend other customers and we proceeded to sip our coffee. AK started to skim through his Instagram feed and then he looked at me.</p>

<p>“So, how are things going for you?” I asked AK.</p>

<p>“Ah, you know, As usual. Nothing to worry about and hey, you were saying something about a dream?” He asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it was so weird. I am still not clear on what happened. It was really strange and random”</p>

<p>“Interesting, tell me more” he demanded.</p>

<p>“So, I was near this building, a house maybe, it was really beautiful and to my left was this lake. It felt like it was daytime but I was feeling really cold and unusual. This house, it starts to pull me towards it and as I was getting closer, everything starts to distort, right? It starts to fade away”.</p>

<p>“Like water spilled on a painting? Disoriented?” AK asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, kind of. I am not sure of how to describe it” I said looking at AK his eyes filled with curiosity and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Carry On” he prompted.</p>

<p>“Then I felt like someone was there with me, and I start to feel someone holding my hand. It was a woman’s hand I believe, and I remember seeing a silver ring on her finger. Then a voice said something like ‘nothing is real’ and that’s it. Everything went to black and I woke up.”</p>

<p>“That’s some trippy shit dude!” He exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it was very strange. AK, do you believe in premonitions?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Premo- what?” he asked confused.</p>

<p>“Premonition. It is like this feeling that something is going to happen, especially something bad”</p>

<p>“Uh huh. You feel something bad is going to happen?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know man” I sighed.</p>

<p>“Dude, why don’t you write about this?” AK suggested.</p>

<p>“Write about my dream? I did think about it. But it is really not my forte. It is not my genre. I only like writing about emotions, you know, romance, you know this!” I said</p>

<p>“Shut the fuck up. You have at least something to start with, right? Have you even tried writing anything other than drama? It is not going to hurt if you try!”</p>

<p>“I guess so.” I said with immense doubt.</p>

<p>“If you are not going to, I am going to use It.” he joked.</p>

<p>I smiled. Though doubtful, at least I had something to start with now and I was in no mood to wait. I really wanted to get my fingers on my typewriter. So, I paid for the coffee, thanked AK for his help and ran back to my apartment. I could feel AK just smiling at me as I hurried to my apartment like an over enthusiastic child.</p>

<p>I took the elevator to the 3rd floor. I hurried to my corridor, opened my room, shut it as hard as I could behind me and sat on my typewriter table with a huge smile on my face. I raised both my hands, moved it towards the letters and my brain froze. My fingers were brushing the letters, resisting to press.</p>

<p>Eventually my smile faded. I let my hands down. I opened the window to get some fresh air. It didn’t satisfy me.</p>

<p>Music!!! Music always inspires me to write. I turned on my PC and started playing some Del Rey as it felt like her songs were more relatable to my dream. After 4 hours of listening session, I still couldn’t write anything. It felt like I was starting to go crazy by now.</p>

<p>I was in no mood to go all psychotic so I took my phone and called AK. He picked after a couple of rings.</p>

<p>“Hey man, how is the writing going on?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing. Just nothing. I am not able to write. I am starting to get crazy here” I said trembling.</p>

<p>“Hey hey hey, calm down. Come to Elliot’s Beach at Seven’ish. We can talk” he said.</p>

<p>“Alright. Okay. What am I to do till then?” I asked</p>

<p>“Eat, play video games, drink, sleep. Do whatever the fuck that keeps you distracted. But you got to keep your cool man. ” he said.</p>

<p>“Alright. Will meet you at the beach then?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. Take care man. Bye. ”</p>

<p>“Bye.”  I hanged the call.</p>

<p>I went to kitchen, looked around if there was something to drink. There was a half empty, no, a half full bottle of Bacardi black rum sitting on top the kitchen drawer. I bought it 3 nights ago. I usually take a peg of rum every now and then to relax. So I grabbed the bottle and a glass, poured some and gulped it down. Nah! It was not enough so, I went for another round.</p>

<p>I took my headsets, plugged it to my phone and hit the shuffle. Empire Ants by the Gorillaz started to play. I went ahead and laid on my bed and before I could realize I dozed off.</p>

<p>I could still hear the chorus though. I felt like standing somewhere. I tried to open my eyes slowly. Woah! I was in near the lake again. But this time I was standing closer to the house. Closer than I got before. I was standing there like a little boy who got lost.</p>

<p>What was different this time was that everything was very clear and bright. There was a feel of warmth within. I was feeling more peaceful and quiet. Oddly quiet. Suddenly, from a distance, I could hear a sound. It was the sound of a girl humming. It seemed like it came from the back of the building. It sounded so sweet and serene. As I started to follow this sound along a small path that leads to the backyard, I took my time to look around the exterior of the house. It looked simple yet very captivating.</p>

<p>The house was surrounded by lush coconut trees bringing in the necessary bliss factor to make the scene perfect. The house was not something you usually happen to come across in the concrete jungle of Chennai. The roof was made of clay. The whole place was so tropical and out of the world.</p>

<p>I got so caught up with the beauty of the surrounding that I forgot for an instance that I reached the backyard and was now closer to humming that I wanted to. Cold wind blows and I look up to find a girl on a swing, her back facing me. It was her who was humming.  The humming called me closer.</p>

<p>I started my walk towards the swing. As I got closer the humming started to fade and the sound of the swing creaking as it went forth and back.</p>

<p>The wind got fiercer and the creaking got louder. I had to shut my eyes and close my ears with my hands to make myself feel less uncomfortable. After a couple of seconds there was no sound. Nothing. I opened my eyes and there was no sign of the wind anymore. The girl was missing from the swing and it wasn’t swinging like it is supposed to.</p>

<p>I felt some air at the back of my neck. It was not wind, no. It was not strong enough. It was very light. Now it became clearer that it was her breathe. She was standing so close behind me. I could feel her hair brushing on the tip my right shoulder send chills down my spine.</p>

<p>“Shiva” She whispered.</p>

<p>Her voice was very cold. Her whisper sounded like burning ice.</p>

<p>Before I could turn my head, and have a glimpse of what was happing behind my back, she whispered again. She said:</p>

<p>“Call out my Name.”</p>

<p>And everything went to black.</p>

<p>I woke up panicking in my apartment room. Trying to catch my breath, I started to look around. It was not a dream anymore, it was a nightmare. With a sense of immense panic, I took my phone to check the time. It was 6.30 PM. Then I took some deep breathes, jumped out of the bed and went to the bathroom.</p>

<p>I switched on the light, which resulted in my eyes hurting a bit as I got used to the dark for a while. I rubbed my eyes with my fists, adjusting my vision in the process.</p>

<p>I looked myself in the mirror, looking more tired and creeped out. I kept staring myself for ten to fifteen seconds maybe thinking about what I experienced and all I had was one thing to say myself.</p>

<p>“Holy Fuck!”</p>
